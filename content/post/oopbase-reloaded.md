Recurring readers may notice that the blog has heavily changed since their last visit. 
They may also see that the blog’s language has switched to english and that this is the only post available right now.

Due to a hacker attack I had to reset the server WordPress was running on. 
I could have restored the old WordPress-Database, but I thought that issue might be a good reason to start over again. 
Now writing in english seems to be appropriate as well since there were mainly readers from the US or other english-speaking countries.

The first “real” article will be part of the [F# Advent Calendar in English](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2016/) and will be published on December 26. I’m looking forward to seeing you then.
